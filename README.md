# An overnight quick, small app 

- Built at the end of a Design Thinking / Ideation Training Week.

- Built to fulfil a small A/B test around Charitable Donations.

- When a user navigates to the URL, they will randomly be presented with either checkboxes to donate or the slider. We then store the amount they choose to donate in the DB. We track the donation amount, average, median. In this way,we can do some analyses around which method leads to higher donations (in total euro amount).

- Angular & Firebase.
- Must have angular-cli, node, etc. to run.
